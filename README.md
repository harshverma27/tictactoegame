# tictactoegame
In This Project, I created a Tic Tac Toe Game in C++.
The code basically works on Array.
It all starts with drawing a board and clearing screen again and again using drawboard() function.
It takes input from user to change the respective block in board to "X" or "O".
At final it user a checkWin() function to check if any player had win, By using a if-condition of every winning posiblity in tic tac toe.
